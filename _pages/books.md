list_title: Written Thoughts on Books I have Read

<!-- > What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.
<br/> – Carl Sagan, Cosmos, Part 11: The Persistence of Memory (1980)

Sometimes someone may ask me what I like to read, and to this question, I often answer "Stories that have interesting characters, an intriguing setting, and an enticing plot." When this is inevitably followed with an inquiry about whose stories best adhere to these characteristics, I almost always answer with one of Gabriel García Márquez (Love in the Time of Cholera), Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World), Louise Erdrich (The Sentence) or Anna Burns (Milkman).


I had a wonderful experience in literature classes during my undergraduate studies, and I've compiled some of those writings here (see 2021 and earlier). The most formative books I have read are One Hundred Years of Solitude (while recovering from a stress fracture in my femur) as a teenager and Crime and Punishment as a young adult. My most fruitful time as a young reader came about in the summer of 2022; living with my cousin Boulder, spending most of my free time hiking beautiful paths and reading in gorgeous parks. It was then that I decided to start writing formally about books, the impetus for this page. Ever since I have had the continuous desire to write down my thoughts about books I am reading or have read and a discontinuous ability to do so.
