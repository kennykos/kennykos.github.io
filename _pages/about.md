I am a CSEM fellow studying Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. My main academic interests lie in the field of numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations, particularly Integral Equation Solutions for fluid flow and wave problems. Outside of PDEs, I am interested in Algebra and the Philosophy and History of Mathematics, though I do not intend to pursue research in these topics.

I completed my undergrad at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I majored in Math and Computer Science. During my time at UIUC, I was heavily involved with [Students for Environmental Concerns](https://secsatuiuc.web.illinois.edu/), a project based environmental advocacy student organization.

When I’m not in school, I enjoy making bagels from scratch, playing 16'' softball, following the teachings of Nolan Ryans’ Pitcher's Bible, and reading (feel free to check out my bookshelf!).

I recently co-authored two articles currently in the peer review process:

* [Know I&#39;m Right, But Does my Phone? Evaluating the Interplay between Trajectory Segmentation and Mode Inference Errors](https://kennykos.github.io/assets/pdf/Sensor_based_multi_step_pipeline_evaluation_framework_SULI-3.pdf) with  Dr. K. Shankari at the National Renewable Energy Labratory
* [Packing densities of Delzant and semitoric polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06415) led by Dr. Joseph Palmer and with Yu Du, Yichen Liu, Jeff Massman, Joseph Palmer, Timothy Thieme, Jerry Wu, Zheyu Zhang though the Illinois Geometry Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

The first article is the culmination of three semesters of work in the Illinois Geometry Lab. I wrote the second article, which I presented at the 2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, while participating in the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship program at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.
