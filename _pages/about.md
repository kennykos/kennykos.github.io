I am a PhD student in the [CSEM program](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/phd-program/) at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences](https://oden.utexas.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of numerical analysis and scientific computing, where I am particularly interested in **fast numerical methods for boundary integral equations**. Im am currently working in the [Parallel Algorithms for Data Science and Simulation Group](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/parallel-algorithms-for-data-analysis-and-simulation-group/) on particle simulations for Stokes flow.
