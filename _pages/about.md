Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a PhD student in the [CSEM program](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/phd-program/) at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering &amp; Sciences](https://oden.utexas.edu/) where I am advised by George Biros in the [Parallel Algorithms for Data Science and Simulation Group](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/parallel-algorithms-for-data-analysis-and-simulation-group/). 

My graduate work investigates methods that *quickly* and *accurately* approximate information as it radiates from a source. 
These methods are the applied to find solutions to *N-body* problems with algebraically decaying kernels in *linear* or *log-linear* time. 
Such N-body problems are prevalent in mathematical physics -- e.g., electrostatics, molecular dynamics, potential theory.
My group applies these methods to the NystrÃ¶m discretization of the Stokes boundary integral equation for [blood capsule simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13908), 
and I specialize in designing and implementing performance portable (i.e., efficiently executable) algorithms for such applications.
