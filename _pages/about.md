I am a senior majoring in Math and Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. After earning my undergraduate degree, I intend to continue my studies at the graduate level in numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations, particularly Integral Equation Solutions for fluid flow and wave problems. Outside of my classwork, I am the president of [Students for Environmental Concerns](https://secsatuiuc.web.illinois.edu/), a project based environmental advocacy student organization. I enjoy making bagels from scratch, playing 16'' softball, and reading (especially novels by Gabriel Garcia Marquez).

I recently co-authored two articles currently in the peer review process: 
* <a href="https://kennykos.github.io/assets/pdf/Sensor_based_multi_step_pipeline_evaluation_framework_SULI-3.pdf" target="_blank">I Know I'm Right, But Does my Phone? Evaluating the Interplay between Trajectory Segmentation and Mode Inference Errors</a> with  Dr. K. Shankari at the National Renewable Energy Labratory
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06415" target="_blank">Packing densities of Delzant and semitoric polygons</a> led by Dr. Joseph Palmer and with Yu Du, Yichen Liu, Jeff Massman, Joseph Palmer, Timothy Thieme, Jerry Wu, Zheyu Zhang though the Illinois Geometry Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

The first article is the culmination of three semesters of work in the Illinois Geometry Lab. I wrote the second article which I am presenting at the 2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, while participating in the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship program at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.
