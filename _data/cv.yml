        - Worked on Evaluating The Interplay Between Trajectory Segmentation and Mode Inference Errors
        - title: <b>Introduced a framework</b> to evaluate accuracy of trip length computations and mode inference for continuous mode-segmented trajectories on groups of trips
          contents:
            - Developed a temporal alignment algorithm to classify temporal and spatial errors in a single metric and implemented the algorithm in python <a href="https://github.com/kennykos/mobilitynet-analysis-scripts/blob/pr_staging/classification_analysis.ipynb" target="_blank">https://github.com/kennykos/mobilitynet-analysis-scripts/blob/pr_staging/classification_analysis.ipynb</a>
