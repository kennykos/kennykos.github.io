Dr. George Biros \\
Working on a performance portable Spectral Ewald implementation for particle-in-cell Stokes flow.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item {\bf Developing a novel particle-to-grid algorithm} to be used in the {\emph particle2grid} stage of the Spectral Ewald method that utilizes {\bf data locality} and {\bf parallelism} to achieve {\bf near-peak performance} on modern machines.  
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
        \item Algorithm development in {\bf PyKokkos}, a {\bf performance portable} python framework. The algorithm will be released as part of a planed {\bf open source} python package for the Spectral Ewald method. 
        \item Performance profiling with the {\bf NSIGHT Compute} suite of tools for runs using NVIDIA's A100 GPUs on the TACC Lonestar 6 supercomputer. These results are compared with {\bf cache aware} pen-and-paper performance modeling.
        \item Invited to AMD tools workship at the University of Oregon port the algorithm onto {\bf HIP} architecture and tune for performance on AMD Instinctâ„¢ series MI300A devices.
