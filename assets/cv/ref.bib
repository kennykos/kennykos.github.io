	abstract = {Exploiting the relationship between 4-dimensional toric and semitoric integrable systems with Delzant and semitoric polygons, respectively, we develop techniques to compute certain equivariant packing densities and equivariant capacities of these systems by working exclusively with the polygons. This expands on results of Pelayo and Pelayo-Schmidt. We compute the densities of several important examples and we also use our techniques to solve the equivariant semitoric perfect packing problem, i.e., we list all semitoric polygons for which the associated semitoric system admits an equivariant packing which fills all but a set of measure zero of the manifold. This paper also serves as a concise and accessible introduction to Delzant and semitoric polygons in dimension four.},

    abstract = { Travel behavior changes are essential to transportation decarbonization. Travel diaries, consisting of sequences of trips between places, are typically used to instrument human travel behavior. However, these diaries are only as accurate as the underlying methods used to construct them. Travel diary algorithms have been a popular research topic since the advent of Global Positioning System tracking surveys. These algorithms have typically been validated using prompted recall of presegmented trips, thus disregarding the continuity of mode inference. Phone operating systems have adopted battery-conserving techniques, but the resulting data collection errors have not been studied extensively. We introduce a framework to evaluate the accuracy of trip length computations and mode inference by analyzing continuous mode-segmented trajectories for groups of trips. We then use the framework to identify the input data quality and the impact of postprocessing. Our primary inputs to this evaluation are MobilityNet, a public dataset containing information from three artificial timelines covering 15 different travel modes, and sample open-source travel diary creation algorithms from the OpenPATH project. Our framework concretely shows that the variance of the distance error drops from (0.217,0.0848) to (0.011,0.0407) (Android, iOS) after postprocessing. Similarly, the weighted F-scores for mode inference increase from (0.25,0.29) to (0.60,0.74) (iOS, Android) between random forest and geographic information system-based models. We hope that this standardized method will be adapted to evaluate other, potentially proprietary, travel diary algorithms. The results can be used to understand and improve the state of the art in the travel diary creation field. }
