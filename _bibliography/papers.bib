 @article{Kosmacher_Shankari_2024, title={Evaluating the Interplay between Trajectory Segmentation and Mode Inference Error}, volume={2678}, ISSN={0361-1981, 2169-4052}, DOI={10.1177/03611981231208154}, abstractNote={Travel behavior changes are essential to transportation decarbonization. Travel diaries, consisting of sequences of trips between places, are typically used to instrument human travel behavior. However, these diaries are only as accurate as the underlying methods used to construct them. Travel diary algorithms have been a popular research topic since the advent of Global Positioning System tracking surveys. These algorithms have typically been validated using prompted recall of presegmented trips, thus disregarding the continuity of mode inference. Phone operating systems have adopted battery-conserving techniques, but the resulting data collection errors have not been studied extensively. We introduce a framework to evaluate the accuracy of trip length computations and mode inference by analyzing continuous mode-segmented trajectories for groups of trips. We then use the framework to identify the input data quality and the impact of postprocessing. Our primary inputs to this evaluation are MobilityNet, a public dataset containing information from three artificial timelines covering 15 different travel modes, and sample open-source travel diary creation algorithms from the OpenPATH project. Our framework concretely shows that the variance of the distance error drops from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] (Android, iOS) after postprocessing. Similarly, the weighted F-scores for mode inference increase from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] (iOS, Android) between random forest and geographic information system-based models. We hope that this standardized method will be adapted to evaluate other, potentially proprietary, travel diary algorithms. The results can be used to understand and improve the state of the art in the travel diary creation field.}, number={7}, journal={Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board}, author={Kosmacher, Gabriel and Shankari, K.}, year={2024}, month=jul, pages={32–49}, language={en} }

 @book{Osipov_Rokhlin_Xiao_2013, title={Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions of Order Zero: Mathematical Tools for Bandlimited Approximation}, ISBN={978-1-4614-8259-8}, abstractNote={Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) are the eigenfunctions of the bandlimited operator in one dimension. As such, they play an important role in signal processing, Fourier analysis, and approximation theory. While historically the numerical evaluation of PSWFs presented serious difficulties, the developments of the last fifteen years or so made them as computationally tractable as any other class of special functions. As a result, PSWFs have been becoming a popular computational tool.The present book serves as a complete, self-contained resource for both theory and computation. It will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and engineers, from mathematicians interested in PSWFs as an analytical tool to electrical engineers designing filters and antennas.}, note={Google-Books-ID: wkG9BAAAQBAJ}, publisher={Springer Science \& Business Media}, author={Osipov, Andrei and Rokhlin, Vladimir and Xiao, Hong}, year={2013}, month=oct, language={en} }
 @article{Shamshirgar_Bagge_Tornberg_2021, title={Fast Ewald summation for electrostatic potentials with arbitrary periodicity}, volume={154}, ISSN={0021-9606}, DOI={10.1063/5.0044895}, abstractNote={A unified treatment for the fast and spectrally accurate evaluation of electrostatic potentials with periodic boundary conditions in any or none of the three spatial dimensions is presented. Ewald decomposition is used to split the problem into real-space and Fourier-space parts, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to accelerate computation of the latter, yielding the total runtime O(N⁡log(N)) for N sources. A key component is a new FFT-based solution technique for the free-space Poisson problem. The computational cost is further reduced by a new adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases, allowing for different local upsampling factors. The SE method is most efficient in the triply periodic case where the cost of computing FFTs is the lowest, whereas the rest of the algorithm is essentially independent of periodicity. We show that removing periodic boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three will only moderately increase the total runtime, and in the free-space case, the runtime is around four times that of the triply periodic case. The Gaussian window function previously used in the SE method is compared with a new piecewise polynomial approximation of the Kaiser–Bessel window, which further reduces the runtime. We present error estimates and a parameter selection scheme for all parameters of the method, including a new estimate for the shape parameter of the Kaiser–Bessel window. Finally, we consider methods for force computation and compare the runtime of the SE method with that of the fast multipole method.}, number={16}, journal={The Journal of Chemical Physics}, author={Shamshirgar, D.

 @article{Jiang_Greengard_2023, title={A Dual-space Multilevel Kernel-splitting Framework for Discrete and Continuous Convolution}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00292}, DOI={10.48550/arXiv.2308.00292}, abstractNote={We introduce a new class of multilevel, adaptive, dual-space methods for computing fast convolutional transforms. These methods can be applied to a broad class of kernels, from the Green’s functions for classical partial differential equations (PDEs) to power functions and radial basis functions such as those used in statistics and machine learning. The DMK (dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting) framework uses a hierarchy of grids, computing a smoothed interaction at the coarsest level, followed by a sequence of corrections at finer and finer scales until the problem is entirely local, at which point direct summation is applied. The main novelty of DMK is that the interaction at each scale is diagonalized by a short Fourier transform, permitting the use of separation of variables, but without requiring the FFT for its asymptotic performance. The DMK framework substantially simplifies the algorithmic structure of the fast multipole method (FMM) and unifies the FMM, Ewald summation, and multilevel summation, achieving speeds comparable to the FFT in work per gridpoint, even in a fully adaptive context. For continuous source distributions, the evaluation of local interactions is further accelerated by approximating the kernel at the finest level as a sum of Gaussians with a highly localized remainder. The Gaussian convolutions are calculated using tensor product transforms, and the remainder term is calculated using asymptotic methods. We illustrate the performance of DMK for both continuous and discrete sources with extensive numerical examples in two and three dimensions.}, note={arXiv:2308.00292 [cs, math]}, number={arXiv:2308.00292}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Jiang, Shidong and Greengard, Leslie}, year={2023}, month=sep }
