The author of this book is Philip reeve. Another book that he wrote is here lies Arthur. The genre was fiction and the Sub-genre is Si-fi. This book is 3rd person. This affects the story because their is multiple main characters. This book is about a girl named Fever and she is a engineer that gets sent on a dig with archaeologist Kit Solent.

This book takes place in London at multiple houses and apartments in the future. This is a special setting because some technology is advanced but not all.

The main characters are Charley and Fever. Supporting characters are Kit, Dr. Crumb, Bagman creech, and Fevers Mom. All the characters are very unique and detailed.

the protagonist in this book is Fever. The antagonist is bagman creech. The setting is set up in the beginning by how Dr. crumb and fever are making paper boys. The rising action is when Fever goes to Kits house and goes into the tunnel. The Climax Is when Fever heard the story about her life. The falling action is when fever gets with the movement. The resolution is when fevers family comes together.

The theme is If you try hard enought you can do anything. My proof is in the story fever creeps on moving foreword and never slows down.
