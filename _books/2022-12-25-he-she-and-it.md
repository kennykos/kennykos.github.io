In the wake of chatGPT and seemingly at the doorsteps of an AI revolution, returning to Marge Piercy's He, She and It allows for a thoughtful exploration into the composition of a human intelligence; delivered with Piercy's classical mix of second wave feminism, environmental alarmism, and dystopian science fiction storytelling.

This book is not without faults. The makeup of the 'Glop' (mass slums in extreme environmental decay and riddled with turf wars) is uncomfortably comprised of a dark skinned working that speaking a slang spanglish  dialect. This of course is contrasted with those living in the 'Multi's' (metropolises run pseudo-governmental multinational corporations), where to largest problem for the white upper class is a loss of freedom to the ruling bodies. As in Woman on the Edge of Time, Piercy lacks the nuance and fineness to tackle complex racial issues, and comes across as do many in her generation: pitying those of differing race -- accepting for granted, rather than challenging, the racial status quo in United States of America.
