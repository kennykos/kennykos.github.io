*Project Girl* is an autobiography of Janet McDonald; an African-American woman raised in Brooklyn housing projects, Ivy League educated, Parisian lawyer. The memoir eloquently documents the pain and resilience in Janet's life; neigh a setback nor atrocity unmet by an even greater repose fulled purely by will.

I find it hard to write about *Project Girl* -- there are scarcely parallels between my life and the life of Janet McDonald. However, we have both been processed though the American Colligate system, though through different veins. As Janet puts it:
> While the others where in college to *be* -- stockbrokers like their mothers, lawyers like their aunts, or professors like their fathers -- I had been told to go to college in order *not to be*: like my mother or my aunt or my father (58-59).

I have long investigated the nature, possessing myself and my peers, that drives us to peruse fields related to to the work of our parents; yet I have never investigated the perspective of a students who is not even afforded the opportunity.

> Risa made the point that Americans are apolitical because we have no stable working class ... She said in Britain the workers have no illusions that someday they will become managers, "metaphorically win Lotto," whereas in the U.S. we are all taught the "Big Lie" -- that each of us has the full opportunity to be anything and have everything, when, in fact, that is only true for actual or honorary members of the oligarchy. I don't know. I like the U.S., but we have a long way to go (169).

"We all seek a sense of belonging, a feeling of connection to something, yet each of us wants also to be special. Not an easy feat (229)"
