Our recollection of life is nothing more than an autobiographical history; an 
amalgamation of biased documentations of concrete events stored in the form of a memory. The 
conflict resulting from the human propensity for unlimited desires whilst operating with scarce 
resources is precisely where the augmentation of our memories occur. The failure of our 
memories to accurately represent events is addressed both in Calvino’s “Invisible Cities” and 
Kafka’s “In The Penal Colony”. In “Invisible Cities”, Calvino constructs two cities - Isidora and 
Zobeide - that address the conflict between memories and desires. In these two cities, Calvino 
utilizes time to agitate the conflict, as well as having time serve as the preeminent obstacle 
between the merging of memories and desires. “In The Penal Colony” addresses the conflict of 
desire and memories in a similar fashion. In the story, the officer of the penal colony is the victim 
of this conflict, which is exposed through the experience of the explorer, who witnesses a 
contradiction between how the officer and the townspeople remember the old commandment. 
Again, time is the agitator of the conflict, yet it is not just time that serves as an obstacle of 
resolution, but also the power of the officer and the inflated ego that power yields. As explored in 
both “Invisible Cities” and “In The Penal Colony”, memories often serve as an extra-factual 
history of past events, inundated with biases incubated by the present desires of those fortunate 
enough to narrate their own stories. 

The city of Isidora is a city of memory, a fantastical city constructed by the youthful 
desires of old men. The fantasies of Isidora are polar, the city has no room for mundane realities. 
Yet Isidora is not a utopia, and in some sense, it is almost a prison. The city is built to house the 
ambiguous desires of young men, men who dream of perfection. Yet these architects are withheld 
from interacting with their creations, as they enter the city in an old age, rendering them as 
nothing more than mere bystanders. In recounting Isidora to the Kahn, Marco Polo comments on 
this plight, explaining that for the architects, 
> Desires are already memories (8)

What Polo’s commentary rests on is the fact that time is a barrier to realization of desires. However, the 
ambiguity of the architects of Isidora strikes a deeper vein. It is all old men who sit and watch the 
young go and live the desires of their youth. Yet if it is all old men who reminisce, then it is also 
all young men who share the same polar desires. And if that is the case, then none of the events 
of Isidora are histories, but merely dreams. And it is here that the contradiction lies. If desires are 
already memories, as Polo claims, then the memories of the architects of Isidora are not based on 
histories, but distorted by dreams. Isidora is a universal falsehood of a city: none who enter may 
ever truly live in Isidora, just as one who always desires perfection will never live it, no matter 
what their memories may say.

Zobeide is a city of desire, a monstrous city, constructed by masses of individual men 
who share a dream of chasing a beautiful woman through an unknown city. In hopes of obtaining 
the women, the architects augment the layout of the city from what was observed in their dreams, 
aiming to trap the woman. Marco Polo ends the rendition of Zobeide with the remark: 
> The first to arrive could not understand what drew these people to Zobeide, this ugly city, this trap (46)

Zobeide is a city constructed by pure desires, yet as time progresses, these desires erode, and all 
that is left is an empty memory. To this effect, Zobeide is a converse city of Isidora: here, desires 
do not overwhelm, but are engulfed by memory. This lack of desires may leave only reality in 
memory, but even this memory is false. Zobeide was built on desires, and thus any history 
without that fact is an inauthentic history. The expulsion of desires from memory has the same 
effect on the architects of Zobeide as the false memories of the architects of Isidora: easing the 
pain of unrealized dreams.

“In The Penal Colony” explores memory through the officer’s recollection of the colony's 
past. Reminiscing to the explorer, the officer describes the olden days of execution, where 
>A whole day before the ceremony the valley was packed with people; they all came only to look
on; early in the morning the Commandant appeared with his ladies; fanfares roused the whole
camp (208)

In this memory, the gruesome and unjust execution is beloved by all, with immense 
admiration shown towards the officer and the Commandant. In this memory, the officer basks 
himself in the former glory of his absolute and unchallenged power, where tyranny was admired 
by layfolk. This memory is of course in stark contrast to what the explorer observes as the 
current state of the colony: archaic decay and uninspired tradition. The pathetic state of the 
officer is confirmed when the explorer leaves the colony, as he exits through the teahouse, where 
the soldier tells him: 
> The old man’s [Commandant’s] buried here … The officer never told you
about that, for sure, because of course that’s what he is most ashamed of (225)

Unlike the universally beloved Commandant of the officers memory, the real Commandant was abandoned 
by the members of the colony, people who could not even grant him the dignity of being buried 
in the churchyard. This reality is in conflict with the officer's memory of the Commandant’s 
absolute and benevolent power, which was in turn absorbed by the officer. The officer knows that 
his power is meaningless if it is not accepted by his subordinates, an acceptance which the officer 
most desires. To reconcile this, the officer conjures false memories of a glorious past where his 
brutality is loved and the Commandment is revered, in which his ego is inflated to a point where 
he may distract himself from the disdain of all who interact with him. For the officer, the 
falsehood of his memories is necessary to render his life meaningful, for he is ashamed from the 
sham of his reality.

The misalignment between memory and history is explored in both Calvino’s “Invisible 
Cities” and Kafka’s “In The Penal Colony” through varying lenses. Yet all cases converge to an 
understanding that the biases of memories can be attributed to unattainable desires, a 
convergence that is dependent on the passage of time. All dream and all live, and it is in the 
difference of these two universal experiences where memory resides.
