In this book review I will tell you the genre of this book, provide a brief summary, tell you the most compelling literary element of this book, tell you why it is the most compelling literary element, what parts I gave interest to,questions I have for the book and my relations from this book to the world or other books. That is what I will tell you in this book review.

This book is a mystery book. The book is mysterious because you don't know the characters names. That is why this book is mysterious.

My summary for this book is: Cassandra is a girl at the age of 11. She is a survivalist. One day she meets a boy named Max-Ernest. That is how they start there exciting adventure to find out how the magician died.

I believe that the most compelling element of this story is the plot. Some reasons I like the plot is because the story is about a secret and I think that is very original way for a book to be written. I also like the characters because they have fake names and the main characters are very adventurous.

There were many parts of the book I found interesting. One was when Cass and Max-Ernest got the invitation to the Terces Society (p. 350). Another was when Cass and Max-Ernest dropped smells into the fire (p. 294). The last one is when Owen came and saved them when they were trying to escape (p. 309).

Some of my questions for the book are: 1) How did Mrs. Mauvais turn Dr. L. evil. 2) Is Owen a spy? 3) Do you think Dr. L. and Mrs. Mauvais will find the secret to immortality? 4) How is Dr. L. and Mrs. Mauvais so old? 5) Do you think Pietro is still alive? Those are some my questions for this book.

I relate this book to Sherlock Holmes because both Sherlock Holmes and Cass are detectives. I also relate this book to Police because both Cass and Police men/women try to stop a crime and or a evil society. For my last relation I relate this book to my brother and I because we always get into big trouble like Max-Ernest and Cass. Those are my relations to this book.

Now I will review this book review. In this book review I will told you the genre of this book, provide a brief summary, told you the most compelling literary element of this book, told you why it is the most compelling literary element, what parts I gave interest to,questions I have for the book and my relations from this book to the world or other books. That concludes my book review.
