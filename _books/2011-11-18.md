The compelling literary element of this book is the plot. The plot is that young boys are stranded on an island and they have to make a society to survive. This is the compelling literary element.
The genre for this book is survival. The reason for that is because they are a a deserted island with no adults.

I will now give you an example of piece of good description. On the last page, Ralph is explaining how sad he is that Piggy and Simon are dead. It really has a lot of emotion.
Questions and comments: 1) What do you think will happen to all the kids once they get home? 2) I didn't get some of the book because it was in English style writing. 3) Will there be a big ceremony for Piggy and Simon.

I can relate this book to myself, the word, and other books. I can relate this book to myself because one time I got lost in the forest. I can relate this book to the world because there is so much death and violence. I can relate this book to Hatchet because in both story's they get stranded by a airplane crash.
I think this book was very good. It had good description and detail. I didn't like how it was formatted. I like the book
